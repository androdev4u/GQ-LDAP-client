Release Notes for gq - THE OpenSource LDAP browser

Version 0.7.0beta2

* New browse-tree popup menu item - "Search below"
* Adding/removing/changing a server definition in the server preferences 
  adds/removes/changes corresponding entries in the browse tree. 
* gq now correctly handles special characters in the bind DN, the bind
  password and the search base in search mode.
* Introduction of the language pack - The main distribution does no longer 
  contain message catalogs. Instead: Download a language pack and follow
  the instructions contained in README.langpack
* Binary data presented in text-form now is shown using a fixed font.
* Many bugfixes

Version 0.7.0beta1

User visible changes:
* There is a popup menu when right-clicking on an attribute label (except
  for "dn" and "objectClass". It allows to view schema information and it
  allows to change how the attribute should be presented visually (the
  "display type", in lack of a better name)
* Added a new display type for the generalizedTime LDAP syntax. It allows
  to choose the day using a calendar. Very convenient if one has to enter
  such timestamps. Actually, this syntax isn't used very often, in my
  stock openldap servers this syntax only gets used for the birthDay
  attribute of class "personalInformation". I use this syntax in my own
  objectClasses though (eg. implementing LDAP based  vacation e-mail
  replies).
* When turing on "show referrals" in the serer preferences the "ref"
  attribute is shown. This is currently mainly useful to get an impression
  of how references ought to work, this feature will probably change in
  the future.
* Password get stored encoded (NOT encrypted) in the configuration file.
  This is just to hide clear-text passwords from the occasional view
  others may glimpse if you open the .gq file in a text editor (even if
  there is no reason to do so)
* Due to password encoding the confgiuration file syntax was changed in a
  backwards-incompatible way!! gq asks if it should upgrade the
  configuration upon start and refuses to change the configuration later
  on if one does not upgrade.
* A new entry in the popup menu of a search result (in a search
  tab) allows to find the object in a browser window. This allows to enter
  objects into the browse tree that might not be found otherwise, eg.
  because of a sizelimit.  From that entry, the tree below it can be
  browsed.
* The base DN combobox in search tabs can be changed now. This is good for
  searches where one needs a different base.  See
  http://www.ldap.research.netsol.com/ldapsearch.html where this can be
  useful.
* Japanese L10N, for those who need it, better support for languages
  having different needs for embedding numbers in messages than
  english/german.
* LDAP URI support instead of hostname + port, this also allows to used
  ldaps:// URIs (that is LDAP over SSL, which is different to STARTTLS)
* The "Add as new" button in the browser
* Allow for the use of the "extensibleObject" class by allowing to add
  attributes to such an object.
* Allow to hide empty attributes from the browser.
* "Beautified" some dialogs
* Added tooltips


Not directly visible changes:
* Bugfixes (some of them were serious, avoid a lot of core-dumping)
* Improvements in LDAP error handling
* gq takes a command-line option "-d" if built with debug support:
   -d 1 shows error numbers in error messages.
   -d 4 constantly displays memory usage on standard out (better if it is
        a tty, actually)

2002-09-29:
Many new features:
* new display type:
  + dt_time - allows dates/times to be entered using a calendar
* Passwords get encoded (NOT encrypted) in the configuration file. This 
  requires changes to the configuration file that make the configuration file 
  unreadable for older versions. Back up your .gq configuration file before
  running 0.7.0 for the first time.
* change how to display data on the fly using a new popup-menu for the 
  attribute-names in browse mode.
* Search mode: Popup menu for search results allows to enter found
  objects into the browse-mode tree. This allows to see more of the
  object tree (in tree form) than would be allowed due to size-limits
* Search mode: The base DN for the search is now editable
* Allow for LDAP URIs to be used instead of Host/Port - this allows
  ldaps:// URIs
* I18N: japanese message catalog by kindly provided by
  Hatuka*nezumi <nezumi@jca.apc.org>. 
* I18N: Proper support for number-translations as implemented by GNU gettext.
* Browser: Allows to hide empty attributes
* Browser: Support for the 'extensibleObject' obejctClass.
* Browser: "Add as new" Button to quickly copy slightly changed objects
* Lots of bug fixes
* Lots of new bugs

2002-06-13:
GQ has a lot of new features, including
* SASL support (Maurice Massar <massar@unix-ag.uni-kl.de>)
* Correct(!) support for userPassword including SSHA and SMD5 encryption.
* I18N support (if you want to contribute please read README.NLS) including
  a rough german translation
* Support for graphical jpegPhoto display (requires gdk-pixbuf to work)
* Support to to view X509 certificates and X509 certificate revocation 
  lists (CRLs)
* Drag and drop support in browse mode (must be enabled using
  --enable-browser-dnd), this feature is possibly dangerous if used without
  thought, but it is GREAT if you need it ;-)
* Supports the OpenLDAP experimental client cache. (must be enabled using
  --enable-cache)
* Lots of other small bugfixes/enhancements

2002-06-12:
Starting after version 0.5.0 Peter Stamfest <peter@stamfest.at> is 
the new maintainer of gq.

I would like to thank Bert Vermeulen for his trust in me, after all
this is his very own project.
